## Description  
This is a simple online chat application developed in Java.  
It allows multiple users to connect to a central server, send messages,  
and receive messages from other users in real-time.  

## How to Run  
1. Start the server:  
   `java ChatServer`  
2. Start each client in a separate terminal or console:  
   `java ChatClient`  
3. Enter your messages and chat with other users.  
4. Type `exit` to leave the chat.  

## Notes  
- Ensure that the server is started before the clients.  
- The application demonstrates basic socket programming and client-server communication in Java.
